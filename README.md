# Sudoku Solver

This repository contains a C++ program that solves a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm.

## Description

This project implements a Sudoku solver using a recursive backtracking algorithm. The solver reads a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle from the user, attempts to solve it, and then prints the solved puzzle. If no solution exists, it notifies the user.

## Features

- Validates the input puzzle.
- Uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzle.
- Prints the solved puzzle or notifies if no solution exists.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- Standard C++ library

### Building and Running

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sudoku-solver.git
cd sudoku-solver
```
2. Compile the program
   ```sh
   g++ -o sudoku_solver sudoku_solver.cpp
   cd sudoku-solver
   ``` 
3. Run the program
   ```sh
   ./sudoku_solver
   cd sudoku-solver
   ```
